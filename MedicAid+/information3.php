      <h2>I Don't Like Needles</h2>
      <h5>You’re not alone: fear of needles certainly prevents some people from donating blood. But if you’re willing to spend a few minutes facing your fears (donating really can be that fast) you may find that the satisfaction you feel makes it worth it.</h5> <br>

      <p> Try the Helpful Tips Below:<br>

      	<br>
      	1.Take Pride<br>
Try to focus on the good you are doing - your blood donation may help save as many as 3 lives. <br>
2.Be Prepared<br>
Before your appointment, read up on the donation process so you know what to expect at every step.<br>
Relax<br>
Listen to music, read a book, talk to our staff, or simply close your eyes and rest for a few minutes.<br>

I'm Not Sure I'm Eligible:<br>
Approximately 38% of Americans are eligible to donate blood at any given time, so there’s a very good chance you meet the criteria.For most donations, these are the basic requirements:  1.Good Health: <br>
You generally feel well, even if you're being treated for a chronic condition. <br>
Age 17 <br>
16 year olds may donate with parental permission in certain states if allowed by state law.<br>
110 lbs<br>
Additional weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger
<br>
<br>
<br>
Is it Safe to Donate?: <br>
Most donors feel fine after donating blood, but if you do feel faint or fatigued, simply lie down until you feel better.<br>
It might help you to think about this: you have about 10 pints of blood in your body. Roughly 1 pint is given during a donation.<br>
Your body can replenish that loss in a short time (a matter of hours for some components, a few weeks for others).<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm Afraid I'll Faint:<br>
During an AB Elite donation, you give plasma, a part of your blood used to treat patients in emergency situations.<br>
AB plasma can be given to anyone regardless of their blood type.<br>

      <h2>How Blood Donation help</h2>
      
      <!--div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div-->
      <img src="Image/information32.jpg" height="900">
      <p>If you’re donating whole blood, we’ll cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand new sterile needle for the blood draw. (This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.)<br>
Other types of donations, such as platelets, are made using an apheresis machine which will be connected to both arms.<br>
A whole blood donation takes about 8-10 minutes, during which you’ll be seated comfortably or lying down.<br>
When approximately a pint of whole blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.<br>
For platelets, the apheresis machine will collect a small amount of blood, remove the platelets, and return the rest of the blood through your other arm; this cycle will be repeated several times over about 2 hours.<br>
<br>
After donating blood, you’ll have a snack and something to drink in the refreshment area.<br>
You’ll leave after 10-15 minutes and continue your normal routine.<br>
Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing you are helping to save lives.<br>
Take a selfie, or simply share your good deed with friends. It may inspire them to become blood donors.
