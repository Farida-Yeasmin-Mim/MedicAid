<strong>Q: Are individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine eligible to give blood, platelets and plasma?</strong>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> In most cases, there is no blood, platelet or plasma donation deferral time after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. However, knowing the name of the vaccine manufacturer is important in determining donation eligibility.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Are individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine eligible to give COVID-19 convalescent plasma?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> While the FDA allows people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine to donate dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma within six months of their infection of the virus, the Red Cross discontinued dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations on March 26 due to declining hospital demand and sufficient industry supply. The Red Cross tests all blood donations for COVID-19 antibodies. Plasma from routine blood and platelet donations that test positive for high-levels of antibodies, and meets other requirements, may be used as convalescent plasma to meet potential future needs of COVID-19 patients.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: I’ve heard claims that the Red Cross refuses to accept convalescent plasma from individuals who have received a COVID-19 vaccine because it wipes out the antibodies. Is this true?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong>  There are claims circulating that incorrectly state that the Red Cross will not accept convalescent plasma donations from those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine because “the vaccine wipes out those antibodies making the convalescent plasma ineffective in treating other COVID-19 patients.” This is not accurate.
The FDA allows people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine to donate dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma within six months of their infection of the virus, based on data that antibodies from natural infection can decline after six months.
The Red Cross discontinued dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations on March 26 due to declining hospital demand and sufficient industry supply. The Red Cross tests all blood donations for COVID-19 antibodies. Plasma from routine blood and platelet donations that test positive for high-levels of antibodies, and meets other requirements, may be used as convalescent plasma to meet potential future needs of COVID-19 patients.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Does giving blood after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine reduce a donor’s protection from the virus?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Donating blood after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine does not reduce a donor’s protection from the virus. Similar to other vaccines such as measles, mumps or influenza, the COVID-19 vaccine is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness. A donor’s immune response is not impacted by giving blood.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: What is the difference between plasma donation and convalescent plasma donation?</strong><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Plasma donation and COVID-19 convalescent plasma donation are different. Plasma has been collected and transfused since the 1940’s to help patients being treated for a number of medical reasons, including burns, shock, trauma and other injuries and illnesses.
