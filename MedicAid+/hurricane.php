  <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts another above-normal Atlantic hurricane season this year,
    and the American Red Cross is urging people in hurricane prone areas to get ready now after back-to-back years of record-breaking hurricane seasons.<br><br>

While experts do not anticipate 2020’s historic storms, NOAA reports this year there could be 13 to 20 named storms with winds of 39 mph or higher.
Six to ten of these could become hurricanes with winds of 74 mph or higher, including 3 to 5 major hurricanes with winds of 111 mph or higher.
2020’s hurricane season set records with 30 named storms and billions of dollars in damages. <br><br>

The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30. However, two tropical storms affected the southeastern states last May,
so it’s critical for people who live in hurricane prone areas to make their preparedness plans now.<br><br>

Last year, extreme weather events created the greatest number of billion-dollar disasters to strike the U.S. in a single year. Compounded by the pandemic,
disasters took an enormous toll on families who spent more nights in emergency lodging in 2020 —  more than 1.3 million —  than any other year over
the past decade.</p>
<br>

<strong>GET READY NOW </strong>
It only takes one storm to devastate a community. Preparing for hurricane season doesn’t have to be hard, just follow these steps to help make sure your family is ready to either evacuate or hunker down if a storm threatens your neighborhood.
<br>
<br>


<strong>1. If you already have an emergency plan, update it and review with family members so everyone knows what to do if an emergency occurs.</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>2. If you already have a disaster kit, now is the time make sure the food and water is still okay to consume and that copies of important documents are up to date.</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>3. Find out how local officials will contact you during a disaster and how you will get important information, such as evacuation orders.</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>4. Download the free Red Cross Emergency app to help keep you and your loved ones safe with real-time alerts, open Red Cross shelter locations and safety advice on hurricanes and other emergencies.</strong><br>
