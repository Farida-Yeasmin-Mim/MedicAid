      <p style="color: grey">Actor and writer James Van Der Beek and wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek, are calling on Americans to give
        the gift of life this summer by donating blood with the American Red Cross in the wake of a difficult and emotional health crisis.<br>

In the past year, the Van Der Beek family suffered back-to-back pregnancy losses that each time required blood transfusions to save
Kimberly’s life. Though donating blood is something James has always done, it was during his wife’s time of need that he thought of
all the blood drives he had missed and how he and too many others take for granted that blood will be available when it’s needed.<br>

“I never realized how important blood donations were until the woman I love most was in a situation where blood made the difference
between life and death,” said Van Der Beek. “Every second to get that bag of blood is a big second. I’m just super grateful that
blood she needed was available because people had donated.”


“You never know when an emergency that requires lifesaving blood transfusions might happen. While most people associate blood transfusions with accidents and other traumas, the reality is that blood is needed every two seconds to support all types of patients in the U.S.,” said Dr. Pampee Young, chief medical officer for the Red Cross. “We are grateful to the Van Der Beeks and their courage to give comfort to others who have experienced similar losses and highlight the importance of blood donation.”

<h5 style="color: black">HEALTH INSIGHTS FOR DONORS </h5>
<p style="color: grey">The Red Cross continues to test all routine blood donations for COVID-19 antibodies. In addition to indicating if an individual has been exposed to the virus, it may also show if the body has generated antibodies as a result of a recent COVID-19 vaccine.

The Red Cross is not testing donors to diagnose illness, referred to as a diagnostic test. To protect the health and safety of Red Cross staff and donors, it is important that individuals who do not feel well or believe they may be ill with COVID-19 postpone donation.

At a time when health information has never been more important, the Red Cross is also screening all blood, platelet and plasma donations from self-identified African American donors for the sickle cell trait. This additional screening will provide Black donors with an additional health insight and help the Red Cross identify compatible blood types more quickly to help patients with sickle cell disease. Blood transfusion is an essential treatment for those with sickle cell disease, and blood donations from individuals of the same race, ethnicity and blood type have a unique ability to help patients fighting sickle cell disease.  </p>

<br>

<h5 style="color: black">BLOOD DRIVE SAFETY </h5>
<p style="color: grey">Each Red Cross blood drive and donation center follows the highest standards of safety and infection control. Additional COVID-19 safety precautions – including temperature checks, social distancing and face masks for donors and staff – have been implemented to help protect the health of all those in attendance. Donors are asked to schedule an appointment prior to arriving at the drive and are required to wear a face mask while at the drive, in alignment with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public guidance.</p>
<br>

<h5 style="color: black">ABOUT BLOOD DONATION </h5>
<p style="color: grey">All blood types are needed to ensure a reliable supply for patients. A blood donor card or driver’s license or two other forms of identification are required at check-in. Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent where allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements.<p>
